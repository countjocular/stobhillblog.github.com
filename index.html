<h1>Stobhill</h1>
<h2>Interface 3</h2>
<bq>We're live-blogging the development of our spooky, exploratory story app at Culture Hack Scotland. It's based on Edwin Morgan's poem Stobhill.</bq>
<h2>An early start</h2>
<p>On the train over from Edinburgh, and the team are already planning the day's work. David has slept through his alarm and missed the train, but Kate speaks to him as soon as the train leaves Waverley. "He's going to put together the first room and send it over, then he's going to get dressed and head for the train", says Kate. "I love that that's a thing that can happen.", says Lillis.</p>

<p>It's early, but we're feeling energetic and optimistic. Well, some of us are.</p>

<h2>Enthusiastic Dave</h2>
<p>Dave has been here all night, composing the soundtrack. He's now been awake for 20 hours solid, and is still going strong.</p>

<p>We filled the entire wall with ideas last night. Lots to do.</p>

<h2>Bring on the luvvies!</h2>
<p>We grabbed a hotel room upstairs to do our voice recording.</p>

<p>We've asked for volunteers from the assembled geekhood ... and we got them. The quality of these takes is just incredible. We've been so lucky.</p>
<h2>It's all coming together</h2>
<p>Meanwhile, back downstairs, New Chris is attaching objects to rooms, and Old Chris is setting up triggers. It's all go.</p>

<h2>So, what exactly is it we're building?</h2>

<p>We're trying to build an interactive 3d game, based on Edwin Morgan's poem <em>Stobhill</em>. The poem tells the story of a young woman who has had an abortion. It's told from the point of view of several different characters, each of whom provides an account in the form of a seperate monologued poem.</p>

<p>We want to explore new ways of presenting literature and story. We're going to be splitting the poem up into pieces, and scattering the pieces throughout our 3d space. The player will encounter the poem over the course of the game. The order in which the poem is discovered is (partially) dependant on the player.</p>

<p>The plot we've come up with is this: you play the role of a young girl, who has been dared by her friends to explore the abandoned Stobhill hospital building. Your only companion is your old, beloved teddy bear - who begins to speak to you once you enter the building. It's spooky, slightly unreal, and full of psycological drama.</p>

<p>As you wander around the hospital, you'll encounter different snippets of Morgan's poem. Gradually, the full story will build itself.</p>
