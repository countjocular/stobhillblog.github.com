<h1>Stobhill</h1>
<h2>Interface 3</h2>
<bq>We're live-blogging the development of our spooky, exploratory story app at Culture Hack Scotland. It's based on Edwin Morgan's poem Stobhill.</bq>
<h2>An early start</h2>
<p>On the train over from Edinburgh, and the team are already planning the day's work. David has slept through his alarm and missed the train, but Kate speaks to him as soon as the train leaves Waverley. "He's going to put together the first room and send it over, then he's going to get dressed and head for the train", says Kate. "I love that that's a thing that can happen.", says Lillis.</p>

<p>It's early, but we're feeling energetic and optimistic. Well, some of us are.</p>

<h2>Enthusiastic Dave</h2>
<p>Dave has been here all night, composing the soundtrack. He's now been awake for 20 hours solid, and is still going strong.</p>

<p>We filled the entire wall with ideas last night. Lots to do.</p>

<h2>Bring on the luvvies!</h2>
<p>We grabbed a hotel room upstairs to do our voice recording.</p>

<p>We've asked for volunteers from the assembled geekhood ... and we got them. The quality of these takes is just incredible. We've been so lucky.</p>
<h2>It's all coming together</h2>
<p>Meanwhile, back downstairs, New Chris is attaching objects to rooms, and Old Chris is setting up triggers. It's all go.</p>
